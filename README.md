# SshSystemService

# Problem Statement: 
Every company needs to run many different ssh commands on their fleet of instances for example: To add new user on some specific instances or on all of instances or creating a user and usergroup etc.
This is a recurring problem and sometimes if not done with right tool set, can be very painful.

# Ssh Service: 
With this, i am trying to solve problem of running any kind of SSH comman on fleet of aws (for now, but can be extended to any) instances like adding user to specific instance or all of them.
